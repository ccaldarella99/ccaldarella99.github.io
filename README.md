# Website Portfolio

This is a repo to both manage and host my [website portfolio](https://christopherjcaldarella.com/).

### Directions
* Use like a typical repo, making changes on branches, etc.
* Merge to trunk when ready to deploy to website.

*Note that updates to the website will not happen instantly, and may take time to update.*
